# Spring Boot test playground project
A playground project created using Spring boot to explore the following test related core features (defined in `src/test/java/UserServiceTest.java`).
- Assertions
- Mocking objects / dependencies via Mokito
  - Mocking return methods: `Mockito.when`
  - Mocking exceptions: `doThrow`
  - Mocking void methods
    - Verify actual method /  path execution: `Mockito.verify`
    - Mock and perform no further action: `doNothing`
- Reporting and test coverage using Surefire and Jacoco.

### Generate and access test reports
All the reports generated by Surefire and Jacoco will be saved into the `target` directory. To generate reports run

```agsl
mvn clean install
```
